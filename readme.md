> **M2**

> Focusing on the M2 international migration assumption, all eight regions are projected to show population increases between 2011 and 2031 with the average annual growth rates  varying from 0.2 to 0.9 per cent under the Recent scenario, 0.2 to 1.2 per cent under the Traditional scenario and 0.1 to 1.0 per cent under the  Modified scenario.

> In the Dublin region the population is projected to grow by 210,000 under the Recent scenario and by 286,000 under the Modified scenario, the variation arising directly because of the additional internal migration flows. The Mid-East region will show the highest growth rate of 1.2 per cent under the Traditional scenario, with corresponding growth rates of 0.9 per cent under the Recent and Modified scenarios.

#### Construction Data
The commencement notice register has been extracted in order to show the area where construction is being completed or ongoing in 2014. This data was obtained from localgov.ie. There are issues as the data is only available as a pdf rather than csv. It is difficult to access and analyze trends.
